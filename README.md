# LearningRequiresIntInf
The code corresponding to the article "Learning to Predict requires Integrated Information" (linkt coming soon). 
There we analyze the behavior of the Integrated Information measure, while the agents learn to predict and navigate their environment. The movement
of the agents is demonstrated in the video below.

In the main.py document one can change the agents from fully connected to limited (no integrated information possible) by setting the integrated information 
variable in line 57 to 0. 
The sensor length can be changed in line 64.
